# Quantum Computing Benchmarks

This repo contains a set of Quantum Computing benchmarks.

Begin by downloading the ipynb benchmark documents from this GitHub. In order to use the benchmarks, navigate to IBM Quantum Experience and log into your account. There, you must press the launch lab tab. Once your server has started up, you must press the upload button from the upper left corner and upload the benchmarks.

Once uploaded, you must press run for each kernel and ensure to run each piece in order. The results can be found right under the kernel run. Not all kernels have output. If you aren't sure if your kernel is running, the upper left hand side of the box will show a * if it is running and will show a number (1,2,3,etc.) if it has finished running. 

Each benchmark has a different output, some being metrics, others being graphs. In order to better understand the metrics, please navigate to this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f5dLYHC5KR7Q52PZADSzOWehL3vyga303q0bLm01tMM/edit?usp=sharing

It is important to note that some of the benchmarks are able to run many different types of circuits, while others are specific to a certain circuit/gate. Again, please check the spreadsheet above for more information.
